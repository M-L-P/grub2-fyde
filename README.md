## 📝FAQ❓️
### Secure Boot
- It might support secure boot if you use `grub.cer`(Secure Boot Certificate), which is what I haven't tried,
- - `grub.cer`(Secure Boot Certificate) is from [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy);
### Menuentries
- I have adapted `grub.cfg` to make the three menuentries generic so that it can boot no matter which partition is `FYDEOS-DUAL-BOOT`.
